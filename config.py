config.py
----------
Centralized configuration for the Vehicle Trajectory Data Collection module.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY:
Every model path, threshold, and tracker setting lives here instead of being
hardcoded inside the main script. This means future modules (red-light
detector, triple-riding detector, wrong-side detector) can import this same
config file and stay in sync with whatever model/thresholds you're using,
without touching the core tracking logic.

When you add new violation modules later, add their settings here too,
in their own clearly marked section at the bottom.

# suppression of frame-to-frame noise spikes.
